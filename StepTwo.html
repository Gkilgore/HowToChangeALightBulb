						Compact fluorescent lamps can replace incandescent lamps that are
						roughly 3â€“4 times their wattage, saving up to 75% of the initial
						lighting energy. They are made of a glass tube filled with a low
						pressure mixture of gases, specifically mercury and noble gases. The
						tube is coated on the inside with a fluorescent material, usually a
						compound containing phosphorous. When the current is switched on,
						the starting mechanism produces electrons that excite the gases
						inside the tube which then release ultraviolet radiation. This in
						turn excites the coating on the inside of the tube, which emits
						visible light through the surface of the lamp.

						An LED lamp or LED light bulb is an electric light that produces
						light using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LED lamps are
						significantly more energy-efficient than equivalent incandescent
						lamps and can be significantly more efficient than most fluorescent
						lamps,[1][2][3] The most efficient commercially available LED lamps
						have efficiencies of 200 lumens per watt (Lm/W).[4][5][6] Commercial
						LED lamps have a lifespan many times longer than incandescent lamps.

						An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light
						globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it
						glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb with a vacuum or
						inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Current is
						supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the
						glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical
						connections.
